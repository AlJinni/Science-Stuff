This folder contains the Fortran 95 source code for Constants.F90, a Fortran 95 module.  In order to compile and link the other Fortran 95 codes for this text you will need to place Constants.F90 in the same folder as the code you wish to compile, or (preferably) you should create a Constants.mod file and place it in a folder that is accessible to your Fortran 95 compiler, such as an \include folder.

Constants is described in Appendix I of:
